And so this article does ","        it by comparing these to their desktop monitors  equivalents, for a task that involves explicit data manipulation. The purpose of the article is to conduct a controlled experiment to compare the performance of physical navigation in ","        front of a wall-size display with virtual navigation using pan-and-zoom on a desktop monitor for this task. The authors aim to understand the interaction effect between display type and task difficulty and to develop guidelines ","        for designing displays for interactive tasks that involve data manipulation.

Searchers used a middle ground approach where there were more containers than classes, ","        and then users would have to place those items into containers without letting the container overflow. The task required users to determine when two items were in the same class, which was represented by a different letter. Information density was ","        operationalized by adjusting font size. The experimenters controlled the complexity of the task through several parameters, including the number of items, classes, containers, and label font size. This approach provides a rich yet easy-to-control ","        design space for experimental tasks based on the abstract task. The experimenters compared the benefits and drawbacks of wall-sized displays and desktop displays in this classification task.","","        \\paragraph{ \\textit{First Experiment :} ","                \\newline }","        \\indent \\indent This first experiment compared user's performance, subjective experiences, and preferences when distinctly using a desktop computer and a large wall display for a pick-and-place task. The experiment used three different label sizes ","        and two levels of task difficulty. The results show that participants' performances were significantly better on the wall display than on the desktop, especially for the harder task and the medium label size. The wall display also resulted in lower ","        subjective mental load and frustration. Almost all participants preferred the wall display, except for the large label size. The study found a strong interaction effect between the display type and the label size, where the desktop with large labels ","        was fast but exploring small and medium labels was painful. Participants also reported different senses of engagement between the desktop and the wall display, where the desktop gave a sense of control while the wall display gave a sense of being part ","        of the interaction.","","        \\paragraph{ \\textit{Second Experiment :} ","                \\newline }","        \\indent \\indent This second experiment aims to test whether virtual navigation techniques on a desktop interface can beat physical navigation on a wall-size display for difficult classification tasks. In this one, researchers compared three different desktop ","        techniques for difficult classification tasks: a baseline pan-and-zoom (PZ) technique, an overview+detail (PZ+OV) technique, and a focus+context (Fisheye) technique. They recruited 12 volunteers aged 22 to 38 with normal or corrected vision and used a within-subjects design.

Nine participants preferred the Fisheye technique, while three preferred PZ+OV.*","        But still, it  showed that physical navigation on a wall-size display outperformed virtual navigation using desktop techniques for difficult classification tasks. Despite the fact that the focus+context and overview+detail desktop techniques performed similarly to the pan-and-zoom ","        technique in terms of task completion time, none of them came close to the performance of physical navigation on the wall-size display. Additionally, while the fisheye lens technique was preferred by some participants, others found it difficult to control and focus on labels despite its ","        high magnification factor.

Authors found that the desktop display was more efficient for easy tasks, but the wall-size display was significantly more efficient ","        (up to 35\\%) for difficult tasks.
