# Wall-VR Project's Explanation

--Late Clarifications--
  During my L3 internship at the LISN with Olivier Chapuis, I've worked on a program that would allow multiple users to do remoted collaborative tasks from different devices (LHRD, Computer, VR Headset) on simple tasks.

--Used Technologies--
  Unity (2020.3.7f1)
  OpenXR Packages
  HTC Vive
  Photon Library (PUN)
  Wild (LISN Wall Display)

--Usability--
  This Project is usable from Linux & Windows devices, but you'll need to download the Project's Library, that I have not put on the git repository due to its size.
